# step-wise-linear-regression
An implementation of step wise linear regression algorithm, to compare the performance of static code metrics in software bug prediction.

The algorithm is used to sort the files in the software modules in the descending order of various measures, which are indicated by the names of their respective files. 

Different ordering measure used are - Original Bug count, Predicted Bug count, PredictedBugs/LOC and predictedBUgs\avg Cyclomatic complexity.

In each of the orderings, a graph plotted against the cumuative Bugs predicted Vs the cumulative lines of code verified, is plotted. the graphs will be put up shortly.
